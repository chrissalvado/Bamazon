# Bamazon

Bamazon is a virtual storefront program that enables the user to purchase products listed in an SQl database. All the product items are listed with price and units available and organized by department name. When the user runs the program the following steps will be taken:

1. All products from the database will be listed with the following information
  * Item id
  * Product name
  * Department name
  * Price
  * Quantity in stock
  
2. You will be asked if you wish to purchase an item today
3. You will be asked for the item number
4. You will be asked for an amount you wish to purchase
5. If the quantity is available your order wil be filled and you wil get an alert , if the quantity is unavailable you will be told to choose again.
6. The database will update reflecting the new available quantity and the program will run again from the start.
